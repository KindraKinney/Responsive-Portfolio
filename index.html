      <p>Hello! My name is Kindra Kinney and I am really excited about starting my journey as Full Stack Web Developer. Currently I coordinate rental furniture for real estate home staging. It has been fun and I have learned a lot, but there is no upward mobility.</p>

      <p>I think the ever changing of the tech industry is what drew me to it most. THere are always opportunities to learn and for growth. I am definitely up for the challenge.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I really enjoy reading, hiking, drinking coffee, playing video games and hanging out with my cats, Kiara and Kovu.</p>
